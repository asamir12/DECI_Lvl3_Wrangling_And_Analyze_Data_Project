# WeRateDogs Data Wrangling & Analysis Project

![WeRateDogs Banner](images/WeRateDogs_Header_Image.jpg)

## Overview

This repository contains my [Digital Egypt Cubs Initiative "DECI"](https://deci.gov.eg/) **Level 3 Data Wrangling and Analysis Project** for the **Level Three: Data Science and AI** course. 

The goal is to practice real-world data wrangling, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the popular **@dog_rates** Twitter account, better known as **WeRateDogs**.

## Project Summary

**Objectives:**  
- Gather raw data from multiple sources (CSV, TSV, JSON API)  
- Assess and clean for data quality and tidiness  
- Merge into a single, well-structured master dataset  
- Analyze the data to uncover what makes dog tweets go viral!

**Data Sources:**  
- `twitter_archive_enhanced.csv` ‚Äî 2,000+ WeRateDogs tweets from 2015‚Äì2017  
- `image_predictions.tsv` ‚Äî Dog breed predictions generated by a pre-trained image classifier  
- `tweet_json.txt` ‚Äî Tweet metadata (likes, retweets) gathered via the Twitter API

## Key Findings

After fully wrangling and analyzing the data, I found that:

-  **Dog Stage Drives Engagement:** Tweets that mention a dog's life stage (*pupper*, *doggo*, *floofer*) receive about **43% more likes and retweets** than those that don‚Äôt.
-  **Strong Likes‚ÄìRetweets Correlation:** There is a clear positive correlation (**r = 0.92**) ‚Äî highly liked tweets also get more retweets.
-  **Most Popular Breeds:** Golden Retrievers, Labradors, Pugs, and Corgis consistently appear in top-engagement tweets.
-  **Images Matter:** High-quality photos are a key driver of engagement.
